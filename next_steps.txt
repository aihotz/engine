## milestone 1: have dummy windows for: editor view, game view, console, directory explorer, scene hierarchy, editing, top bar

- gameobject
- component
## milestone 2: objects with components. use editor view to show a list of components

- transformations
- transformation component
- hierarchy system
- scene hierarchy
## milestone 3: objects can have children

- renderable
- texture
- shader
- shader program
- model
- vertex
- basic rendering
- editor view
## milestone 4: start showing objects in editor view

- imguizmo integration
## milestone 4.1: imguizmo

- material
## milestone 4.2: material

- resource manager
- file io
- scenes
- component save/load
- logging
- exceptions
- console
- can add components to a game object
## milestone 5: save and load scenes. Also have something show in the console

- prefabs
## milestone 5.1: prefab serialization/instantiation

- tags
## milestone 5.2: tags

- windows file dialog for reading/writing
- custom type for projects so that clicking opens editor
- load project

- save as project
- top bar
- saving layouts! (+ reseting)
## milestone 6: basic editor functionality

- load recent (make certain editor data persistent)
## milestone 6.1: load recent

- directory explorer
- file traversal
## milestone 6.2 directory explorer

- handle reloading game dll
- run game
- file watch
- can create custom components
## milestone 7: game realoading!

- reflection
- can edit a game object
## milestone 8: editor!

###### future
- memory manager
+ (game objects could have a pool for them instead of doing manual allocation each time)
